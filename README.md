### Join me as I master JavaScript! :grinning:

I will be working on things that I struggle with until I get them. I may even do small projects to practice JS and I will post them here.

If you are also learning JS, follow my progress. I will be posting all the problems that I work on with the questions and answers separated.

Also I must mention that I will be using the JavaScript-Learn by Practice course on Udemy to get questions and answers(once I've tried them myself). I will specify if it is a question I made up but for now these are questions from other sources. Unfortunately, the course mentioned is not accessible on Udemy at this time.
